/**
 * create a height method for binary search tree
 * height(node)
 *
 * height is the number of edges in the longest path from given node to leaf node
 *      a
 *     / \
 *    b  c
 * the height of this will be 1 from a - 0  to leaf node
 *
 * you want to do it with either iteration or recursion
 *   but you want to do it first with iteration
 *
 * you may want to use either the level order traversal or with pre in and post orders
